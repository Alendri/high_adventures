# Flying big, finally

The A380, majestic beast that it is has never trafficked any route I've flown. That is until I required a last minute flight to Thailand and Emirates came up as a competitive price alternative with two stops.

This was going to be great, a high adventure no doubt! With one of the most reputable airlines in the world and the premier carrier using the A380 no less.

The fact that there is an entry here about this trip would be indication that this trip turned in to a real adventure.
