# To the airport

## 04:30
It was bloody early. Long before the moons domain ended. Too early! First goal was to make the airport bus departing from the bus aprons of the central train station at 05:40. This is the time of day when even the city bus drivers are still asleep. Walking it was, at 05:00 in November, in Scandinavia. Cold.

Thankfully I have learnt how convenient it can be to travel with a backpack as main luggage, this was another moment I was happy for that. Threaded the carryon backpack over my shoulders facing forward and groaned while I got accustomed to its weight pulling me forward, then shouldered the big luggage on the intended way. Stepped in to my nice shoes - dress to impress and also they are so much easier to take off and put on. After all there was an expected minimum of three security checks and several flights over the next day and a half.

All mittens, caps and other winter paraphernalia were left behind, I was headed tropical after all. A wind breaker with a hood on top of a shirt would have to do. Excitement to be on the way hit and an unconsciously high walking pace follow. Together with being sandwiched between two heavy backpacks the feared cold turned in to welcome whiffs of fresh air. The bus stop soon was ahead of me and the station clocks showed I had walked quickly indeed, too quickly.  
Wait wait wait.

I had enjoyed the fresh early morning air. Apparently my fellow passengers with rolling luggage, thick jackets and mittens had not felt the same and requested the driver turn up the heat. Which he did, with a vengeance.  
The calf positioned close to the heating element of the bus was soon feeling the burn forcing me to place part of the carryon backpack in between. It was soon hotter than my equatorial destination was going to be, ridiculous.

There was a single stop on the way to the airport, a city halfway between my embarkation and the destination. By the time we stopped at the single stop between my embarkation and the destination airport I was red faced and utterly thankful to quickly take a few steps outside to cool myself and breathe some fresh air.

Consuming some of the brought food was good and with forced focus almost half the work I had planned for the day was done by the time we pulled up to the airport.
