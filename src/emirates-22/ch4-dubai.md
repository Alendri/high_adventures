## Finally up to temperature
After the hours of walking I was finally up to temperature and rather hungry. I filled up my thermos with water from a drinking fountain and headed to gate C20 which I had passed many times and only ever saw a single person at. Once there I slumped on one of the many benches, ate the last of my second baguette, read my book a bit and contemplated hibernation.
My body and mind was exhausted and I was not sure I would wake up from my alarm even at the relatively quiet gate C20, the circadian laws hitting me hard. This was not the moment to fall asleep.

When I existed the gate area I noticed there were far fewer people in general. I consulted the departure screens, a large wave of departures had taken place. Many of the travelators were empty and my mind started flirting with ideas of running along them, arms flailing and screaming as if hunted by a lion. Or better yet walking the opposite direction pretending to be stuck at that spot until someone noticed me and started a commotion.

Not tired enough to listen to the tiny voices in my head I decided this would be my moment to find someone to talk to, surely there would be some other people around that wouldn't mind some company - or at least some idle chatting.  
I started doing another lap of B-C terminals and quickly found my selfassigned task might not be as easy as I had thought. Most people were sleeping - probably waiting for the next big wave of departures just like myself. Those that were not sleeping were glued to their phones. Disturbing someone who might be in a video chat or watching a movie didn't feel right, find someone reading a book instead, disturbing that feels more acceptable somehow. 

On more than one occasion I reflected I may be the only one at that airport that reads books. 45 minutes in to prowling it finally happened, I spotted a fellow reader in the distance and better yet they were looking up from their book. I immediately changed course, almost walking in to the path of one of the golf carts constantly ferrying people round the terminals.  
After the cart had departed my new path I saw the reader had put the book in their carry-on and were looking with a firm gaze at the nearby gate announcement screen which now read "boarding". I slowed and sure as poop in my babys midday diaper a few seconds later they departed their seat and headed toward the gate.

If anyone was observing me I am sure I visibly exuded my disappointment before I set my mind straight to not dwel on it. After another half lap of the two terminals I said "screw it!" to myself and vyed to approach anyone that looked talkative. Maybe someone using a computer rather than a phone, or maybe a group at one of the restaurant.  
A few steps later a lone girl sitting in one of the otherwise deserted restaurants. She was staring rather intently at a screen, but there was no flickering of fast moving movie scenes reflected at her face, and she had not spoken. She was probably reading! GO GO GO!  

## Thank you for keeping me company
"Would you mind some company?" I asked while approaching her table.  
"Yes", she replied while seemingly indicating that she meant "No". I froze, my tired mind was not sure exactly how to proceed - Supid opening line in a place where people are tired and might not natively speak english!  
She probably noticed my momentary hesitation and indicated more clearly to a chair, queue "woop-woop", "woohoo" and other happy noises inside my head.

Turns out she had been working in the financial sector, recently quit her job and before her next gig started up she was going to visit her sister. A sister who - by international airport destination measurements - lived not far from my port of origin, now what's the chance of that I wonder.  
I have a feeling I rambled on a lot and didn't nearly ask her enough questions, but then again she might have been put off by being questioned in public by a stranger too much. It was lovely to have a break from walking and this young lady from Vietnam through Hong Kong now working in Singapore spent the next two hours conversing.

Once her flight was coming up she excused herself and I almost fell getting out my chair. After the inaction of the previous flight, hours of more or less constant walking and then sitting for two hours cramps hit my calfs with fierceness the likes I have seldomly felt.  
Considerable effort was spent to not show this stranger of my wobbly legs and borderline tears. I waved and thanked her for the company and studiously pointed my toes in the opposite direction to minimize any chance of an awkward side-by-side walk after saying goodbye. Not that my lower legs permitted anything other than a slow stagger at that moment.  
My left big toe also started pinging my brain for attention, blister coming up probably.

The fart I had been holding in quickly made itself known after a few steps, though the rumbling might indicate more than just some methane. My calfs were happy for the travelators as I made my way to the secluded toilets I had scouted out earlier. I muttered to myself that someone must have put an extra brick or three in my bag while I was chatting, I slumped on the procelin throne as my knees almost gave out.

## Final moments before boarding m

Feeling far lighter afterwards I stretched in the dimly lit terminal extension, accutely aware that there were people sleeping under and behind the rows of seats along the walls.
