# Finally flying the A380

An airy cabin with wider seats and great leg room greeted me once I reached my seat.



## Shoutout, this time to the teacher
My elbow buddy this time around turned out to be a teacher. Very friendly, considerate and knowledgeable. 10/10 would recommend.  
They were a currently residing in one of the 'stans - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan. I believe I have embarrassingly little knowledge of the region, however I can at least name the countries and find them on a map. I relayed my disappointment in not knowing more about the region and was met with somber nodding - probably expected.

However as we continued talking something crept up from the back of my mind and I started talking about cotton farming and soviet river diversions. The teacher affirmed this was indeed about the region and Uzbekistan in particular. Slowly I started dredging up knowledge I did not know I had. The disappearing Aral sea came to mind and a bunch of facts about the water supplies of the Uzbekistani outback started flowing out of me - unlike the actual water supplies.

It took another 15 minutes before my mind was engaged enough that I put together the source of the knowledge. I had weeks earlier watched a video called [Why Russia Destroyed the World's 4th Biggest Lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp0Sxn42TGs) by RealLifeLore. Highly recommended.

Then I asked about the flags, I believed that one of the 'stans had a flag with the distinction that it is one which counts its territories with markings on the flag. Such as the stars on the USA flag having represented the number of states.  
The teacher did not know if this was true because they could not remember what all the flags looked like or if they had any countable markings that may represent regions or states.

It took me until the next day until I figured out where this belief had come from. It was the answer to a question posed on the podcast [Lateral by Tom Scott](https://lateralcast.com/), [Episode 6](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5hY2FzdC5jb20vcHVibGljL3Nob3dzL2xhdGVyYWxjYXN0/episode/NjM2M2E4OWU1OGY4NTYwMDEyODI5ZjIy?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjA6IH014z8AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ) at just over the 14 minute mark.
