# Finally flying the A380

I ignored the naughty idea intruding on me and used the boarding arm designated for my seat and entered the aircraft. An airy and overall pleasant cabin with wider seats and great leg room greeted me once I reached my seat.  

This time around the wait to get a neighbor was significantly shorter. Soon there was a presence next to me beckoning to be let in to the seat next to me.

Immediately upon sitting back down I noticed that the support struts for the seats in this A380 were the same as in the previous B777 aircraft. The dread coming over me was laden with flashback misery and tired exasperation. However it was quickly clear this would not be nearly as bad this time around.  
First of all my new friend was not nearly as big as my previous companion. And on top of that the wider seats meant any angling done to accommodate their legs and feet would not be nearly as severe.

As early as felt decent I requested the attention of crew and and again explained about my allergies. Unsurprisingly again I was greeted by a questioning face; they had not been informed.

> Excerpt from my feedback to Emirates support  
> As I now expected [the crew member] had also not heard about my allergies and were very confused as to what to do and told me "just to be sure don't eat any food". Again she told me that she would see what she could find, maybe fruits from business class.

## Shoutout, this time to the teacher
My elbow buddy this time around turned out to be a teacher. Very friendly, considerate and knowledgeable. 10/10 would recommend.  
They were a currently residing in one of the 'stans - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan. I believe I have embarrassingly little knowledge of the region, however I can at least name the countries and find them on a map. I relayed my disappointment in not knowing more about the region and was met with somber nodding - probably expected.

However as we continued talking something crept up from the back of my mind and I started talking about cotton farming and soviet river diversions. The teacher affirmed this was indeed about the region and Uzbekistan in particular. Slowly I started dredging up knowledge I did not know I had. The disappearing Aral sea came to mind and a bunch of facts about the water supplies of the Uzbekistani outback started flowing out of me - unlike the actual water supplies.

It took another 15 minutes before my mind was engaged enough that I put together the source of the knowledge. I had weeks earlier watched a video called [Why Russia Destroyed the World's 4th Biggest Lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp0Sxn42TGs) by RealLifeLore. Highly recommended.

Then I asked about the flags, I believed that one of the 'stans had a flag with the distinction that it is one which counts its territories with markings on the flag. Such as the stars on the USA flag having represented the number of states.  
The teacher did not know if this was true because they could not remember what all the flags looked like or if they had any countable markings that may represent regions or states.

It turned in to the next day until I figured out where this belief had come from. It was the answer to a question posed on the podcast [Lateral by Tom Scott](https://lateralcast.com/), [Episode 6](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5hY2FzdC5jb20vcHVibGljL3Nob3dzL2xhdGVyYWxjYXN0/episode/NjM2M2E4OWU1OGY4NTYwMDEyODI5ZjIy?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjA6IH014z8AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ) at just over the 14 minute mark.

## Food services
Compared with the first flight I was surprised with the magnitude of comfort improvement between the first and this flight. The spaciousness was expected, but so very silent and hardly any vibrations at all from landing gears, wind or engines. However the organization of the cabin crew went the opposite direction unfortunately.

> Excerpt from my feedback to Emirates  
> Every meal they did try to feed me the food even after my initial interaction, so clearly there was no team-communication. ...  
> Apart from [my] food issues the cabin crew were friendly mannered but compared with the first flight it was [...] a bit like a chicken coop. The carts came up and down the aisle a lot because; attendants themselves needed to get past, it had ran out of something, it was full [of garbage] already and a few times the carts were seemingly in the wrong order?

As expected on most flights not everyone can have the meal they prefer. Sometimes not being able to eat might have its silver lining, I did not have to worry about if my choice would be available. I am not sure if the airlines are collecting data on how many did not get their first choice or maybe only if a specific meal ran out.  
It is also well known that food is served from front to back. Which means usually a seat in the back is more likely to not get their choice. Around me very many people did not get their choice of beef, and in fact the beef would have been my choice too.

I was given three plums. That was my entire allotment of food for this flight. Apparently they had forgot to load other fruits for business class so there was nothing for the hard working crew to pilfer for me.  
O well, my remaining baguette and provided tea was complimented well by the plums.

The folks waiting for beef mains were waiting for a long time. Had it taken much longer for them to be informed of the missing beef and receive fish instead I am sure the first vibrations felt on that flight would have been stomachs grumbling  
The delay was long enough for the lucky who had gotten their mains immediately to have already finished their entire meal. It was also long enough that most waiting people had long since finished the drinks they had received. This of course created even more running for the crew as people requested new drinks, most were told the drinks cart was coming around again and others got their new request from a crew member.

The garbage collecting started before the late-eaters had finished so they were stuck with their trays for a very long time or until they requested crew to come specifically for that reason.

## The nuttiness continues
The lovely companion I now had next to me had overheard my discussion with the crew about my allergies and so when - to my great surprised - the crew started handing out nuts to every passenger she asked if I would like her to eat hers later. I said I would greatly appreciate it. _Thank you!_  
I also explained that I am generally not allergic to nuts in the air, but with the quantity of bags opened by the hundreds of people on the aircraft might change that. The much more real problem would not become that not a single surface of this aircraft was safe for me. I would need a bunch of wet wipes just to use the outhouse so I can scrub everything from the lock to the seat.

I thought all carrier had stopped with this nonsense in the 90's or early 00's. Seems 2022 was the year I found out Emirates and Thai Airways did not get that memo. I do not expect nut free flights but there is a huge difference between some having some nuts, possibly even brought by themselves and handing them out to everyone. If it is such an important part of the corporate image I can understand if they _offer nuts on request_. 

## Honorable mentions
The pilot did an excellent job landing this flying castle. The tail camera revealed we had a not insignificant crosswind because the nose was never pointed directly at the runway as we approached.  
A butter smooth touchdown followed by a perfect pivot to let the nose gear down very gently exactly on centerline. Impressive flying, impressive engineering!

The carrier was an utter letdown. The crew was as friendly as I expected and anything negative said here I do not believe to be their fault. The problems seem more systemic to me. 

But oh did the A380 ever live up to expectations!
