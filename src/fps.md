# An idea for a possibly balanced FPS

For the longest time I have been an avid fan of the `F`irst `P`erson `S`hooter genre of games. However many casual sessions have been ruined by the ever present Sniper *AHHH!!*, which is very difficult to deal with without a team.

This is my brainstorming for a balanced FPS game.

## Some introductory concepts for the non-gamer
> **Casual games**  
> For anyone not so well-versed in FPS gaming a `casual game` is a game where unknown people play together in a multiplayer match online.  
> This is usually fun and game developers try to create match-making systems which pair players of similar skill level together in a match.  
> Crucially however the players have probably never played together and may be novices to team gameplay so team strategy might not be very good.
> 
> This is contrary to `ranked or competitive games` where players are expected to enter as teams or at the very least be versed in how a team member should behave in the particular game.
>
> The rest of this brainstorming is focused on `casual games`, because the dynamics of `competitive ranked games` can be so different the same concepts may not translate at all. But some might.

> **Game balance**  
> The term `game balance` is most often used to talk about how fair aspects of a game are.
> For example;
> - Are there items in a game which makes you win immediately?
> - Are some gameplay aspects disadvantaged to the point where it is no longer fun to play the way you prefer?
> - Is the in-game currency used responsibly?
> - Are the playable characters designed in a way that makes sense or is there a particular one that is better or worse?  
>
> These are a few among very very many aspects which affect `game balance`.  
>
> However when it comes to multiplayer FPS games `game balance` almost always used in relation to one of two concepts;
> - Is the game arena equal for all player or all teams, is it a `balanced map`?
> - Are the weapons in the game fair, are the `weapons balanced`?  
> *Is there a weapon which is clearly much better than all others* Ahem..sniper..ahem *- then no?*
>
> This balancing breakdown deals with `weapon balance` strategies in particular.

## That feeling...
The idea of game balance has probably crossed the mind of most FPS multiplayer participants at some point even if we do not know the concept by name. It certainly came to my mind back around the turn of the millennium when I played Unreal Tournament 99. 

`"Wow, that weapon seems so great, I want it!"` is a common thought. Except once you get it you slowly realize you need skill too. It probably isn't better than the other weapons, you just need to learn how to use them all in the most optimal way. This the first inkling many players have to the concepts of game balance.  
Although realizing the skill part usually requires a few frustrated expletives to be uttered before the proverbial coin finally drops.  
The sniper weapon has a special spot in most peoples mind, often it feels overly good compared with other weapons for reasons we shall soon discuss, especially if the player practices using it.  
This has somewhat been turned upside down in some recent titles where companies have put some in-game items, characters and weapons behind micro-transactions or by making obtaining them without paying real-world money ludicrously difficult or time consuming. Creating a pay-to-win scenario, where spending real-world money gives you a better weapon or item.  


## Balancing the sniper
Putting that aside let us get to the idea which has popped up in my mind.

I have never taken any of my grumbles or thoughts any further than just grumbles and thoughts. However I recently came across a video called [SNIPERS: A nightmare for developers and players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOebGm_jMLY) by the YouTube channel Arch which sparked my late night brain as I was trying to sooth the toddler to sleep.  
The video is a very detailed breakdown on the problem of balancing a game arsenal which includes a so called Sniper and probably required for the rest of this to make sense.

With all the excellent points covered in the video about the sniper weapon already covered let us focus on the other aspect of the equation, the target. How about we introduce a kind of armor which would stop the bullet more effectively on short range and progressively worse on long range?

Initially that does not make sense at all but hear me out here. Bullets have kinetic energy. There are several mechanisms in reality that react somewhat counterintuitively to kinetic energy, such as non-Newtonian fluids and ferromagnetic materials in electrical and magnetic fields. What if we pretend our armor was created with some combination of those things, so that higher velocity and more concentrated the force the more aggressively the armor stops the bullet.  
Since the sniper bullet has the most force and the most concentrated hit point it would be the most affected. The bullet looses some momentum as it travels further and therefore would be more aggressively stopped at close range and less at far range.

The armor can be said to "overload" when multiple shots are hitting it simultaneously or in succession. Overloaded armor would be less effective at stopping bullets. Meaning the effect is less noticeable for other weapon types.

To ensure this does not immediately mean that the sniper player looses every close quarter encounter the armor absorbing a shot may affect the mobility of the player, it may even "glow" around the point of impact to indicate heat dissipation if some kind of magnetic effect was indicated.
