# Lime green

_"Banana yellow, banana! *baby noises* Lime green daddy daddy! Daddy! Lime green!"_ she loudly exclaimed from the top of my shoulders.  
I replied _"Yes, you are right, a lime green car!"_ while trying to contain my chuckle at my own shortsightedness.

### A few hours earlier
_"Ok, we can watch one more Magic Fingers video,"_ I said before continuing, _"but only one more. Then we have to go to school."_

Face lighting up she promptly started swiping the row of preview thumbnails representing other videos. A minute or two in the color lime green was introduced. Until then all the colors we had encountered in the Magic Fingers videos were the ones you would expect. Green, red, purple, pink, blue, yellow and so on.  
Generally we practice all the colors we have learnt with objects we see around us. I did not even repeat the name of the color, but she did, along with the video. As always.

_Why would a 2 year old need to know lime green?_ was my immediate thought. What do I know that is lime green to show her? Nothing came to mind. The limes aren't even that kind of green around here.

To my knowledge this was the first time she had heard of the color lime green.

After school we went to town to get food. She was very happily exclaiming things she recognized from her perch on my shoulders as we walked along the afternoon market street. Suddenly she shouts _"lime green"_ while pulling my ears. I stopped and swiveled on my feet and would you believe it; the first and only time I've seen a lime green car in Thailand.  
I could not help but chuckle, of course today would be the day we actually saw something truly lime green, and of course she would remember the sight and sound of the color from a 30 second clip in a five minute video watched between frantic bathing and rushing to school.

Those educational videos are magic! I wish I could soak up new words with the amazing ability of this multilingual baby.
